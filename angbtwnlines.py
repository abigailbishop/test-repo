# Given the x, y, and z location of a particle in three places, calculate the 
#   angle between the first two points and a detector in between the last two 
#   points and between the path of the outgoing particle(s) and the plane
#   then draw the path on a 3D plot

# DETECTOR SETUP
#    *             Incoming particle - Path vector denoted by I
#   -----------    Top GEM - Beam location in this plane denoted by T
#   -----------    Middle GEM - Beam location in this plane denoted by M
#   -----------    Cherenkov Detector - Beam location in this plane denoted by D
#   -----------    Bottom GEM - Beam location in this plane denoted by B
#            *     Outgoing Particle - Path vector denoted by O
